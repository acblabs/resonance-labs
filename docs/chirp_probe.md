# Chirp Probe

Default Phase 1 chirp settings:

```json
{
  "signal_type": "log_chirp",
  "start_hz": 500,
  "end_hz": 10000,
  "duration_ms": 500,
  "pre_roll_ms": 250,
  "post_roll_ms": 1000,
  "amplitude": 0.35,
  "fade_ms": 10
}
```

The chirp is intentionally conservative:

- Maximum default amplitude is capped at `0.35`.
- The waveform is faded in and out.
- The UI warns against headphones and earbuds.
- The API treats Phase 1 alignment as a placeholder.

Phase 2 should add matched-filter alignment, direct-path handling, transfer-response features, and golden audio tests.
